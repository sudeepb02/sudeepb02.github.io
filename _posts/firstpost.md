<p>Hi.. Welcome to my site. This is my first post and I have no idea what I am supposed to write here. But I need to get this done, so I'm writing here whatever comes to my mind.</p>

<p>I thought of starting my first post with "Hello World!" and then writing about myself, but then after typing everything, I deleted that, don't know why, but yeah,I just did. This site will be more of a personal site and a blog, with my ideas, projects and research about different topics. Most of the topics will be technical in nature, but the posts will break down the topic in easy and simple to understand language, with real world examples. </p>

<p>I plan on publishing a copy on medium as well and most probably I will publish my first technical post next week. I hope my posts will be helpful to the community and people will enjoy reading the posts. Thanks for visiting my site and reading this stupid post :P</p>

<p>This site is hosted on Github Pages and powered by Jekyll and Minimal Mistakes. Be sure to check it out. If you need any help setting up your own site with Github pages, you can ping me anytime. I did quite a bit of research while setting up this one</p>
